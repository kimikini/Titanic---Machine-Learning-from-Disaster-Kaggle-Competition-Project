# Titanic---Machine-Learning-from-Disaster-Kaggle-Competition-Project
**🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction – Kaggle Competition**<br>
This repository contains my analysis and machine learning models developed for the Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic

**🎯 Objective**<br>
The main goal of this project is to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using various machine learning techniques.

**📈 Project Versions**<br>
I developed and refined four different versions of the model throughout this project, each improving upon the last in terms of feature engineering, model selection, and performance tuning.

**🏆 Best Score**<br>
My highest score on the Kaggle leaderboard so far is 0.78229.


**Description**<br>
The data sets<br>
One train data set: 891 passengers whose label is known (missing value exist)<br>
One test data set: 418 passengers whose label is unknown (missing value exist)<br>

**Variables**<br>
Survival: 0 = No, 1 = Yes (Target)<br>
pclass: ticket class (1 = 1st, 2= 2nd, 3 = 3rd)<br>
sex<br>
age: age in years<br>
sibsp: # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic<br>
parch: # of parents / children abroad the Titanic<br>
ticket: ticket number<br>
fare: Passenger fare<br>
cabin: Cabin number  <br>
embarked: port of embarkation <br>
